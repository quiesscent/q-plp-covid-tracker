# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

**Author:** Ephesians Lewis
**Description:** This project focuses on tracking and analyzing global COVID-19 trends. It uses real-world data to explore metrics like cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries and regions. The project visualizes trends over time using various plots and charts.

## Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze time trends of cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations.
- Compare metrics across countries and regions.
- Visualize trends using various plots and maps.
- Generate insights from the data and communicate findings clearly.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting data visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly**: Interactive maps and visualizations.

## How to Run/View the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   `git clonehttps://github.com/quiesscent/q-plp-covid-tracker.git`

2. **Install dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the `COVID-19 Global Data Tracker.ipynb` file to run the notebook.

## Insights and Reflections
- **India** shows a steady growth in cases but has also made significant progress with vaccinations.
- The **United States** experienced a sharp rise in cases early on but quickly implemented widespread vaccinations.
- **Kenya** has comparatively low cases and deaths but has seen steady trends in its response.
- The **Death Rate** varies significantly across countries, which could be attributed to differences in healthcare systems, testing rates, and vaccination coverage.
- The **Choropleth map** illustrates how different regions are affected differently, highlighting global disparities in case numbers and vaccination efforts.
